In this lab, you will explore essential DevOps tools and set up a project on the Fleek service. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: Research and Select Essential DevOps Tools

**To get 6/10**:

1. Use the `lab2` folder for this lab.
2. Research and select three essential tools commonly used in the DevOps ecosystem.

   - Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context
   - Key features and functionalities
   - Use cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios
   - Don't copy-paste, please use your own words. A short and simple answer is sufficient.

## Task 2: Set Up Project on Fleek.co

**To get 4 more points**, you need to set up a project on the Fleek service and share the IPFS link in your report:

1. Research what IPFS is and gain an understanding of its purpose.
2. Explore the Fleek service and familiarize yourself with its features.
3. Sign up for a Fleek account if you haven't already.
4. Use your fork of the Labs repository as your project source. **You may set up your own website, but please notify us in advance.**
5. Configure the project settings on Fleek.
6. Deploy the Labs repository to Fleek, ensuring it is uploaded to IPFS.
7. In the `FleekResearch.md` file, provide the following details:
   - Describe the steps you took to set up the project on Fleek.
   - Provide the configuration settings used for custom domains, SSL/TLS encryption, and CDN integration, if applicable.
   - Share the IPFS link and custom domain of the deployed project.
   - Share any observations or insights gained during the setup process.
   - Ensure you use your own words to describe the information.

Ensure that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the `lab2` folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

Note: It is essential to actively explore the Fleek service and its features during the lab to gain hands-on experience and a better understanding of its capabilities for hosting on IPFS.
