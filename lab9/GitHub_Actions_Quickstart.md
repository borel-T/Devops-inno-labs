# Github Actions

```
DevOps Toolchain Category: Version control, CI-CD
```

## Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline:

Observations: Actually it is quite simple. The steps to setup this pipeline are :

- I crreated a '.github/workflow' directory in from the project source
- Inside this directory I created a 'github-actions.yml'
- I copy and pasted the actions to run in the 'github-actions.yml' file
- I Committed the changes on the branch

Observations:

- Each time I push a commit on the branch having the workflow-actions, the actions specified in the YAML file runs.
